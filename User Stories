Goal: You have been contracted to build a prototype for a person search for a top-secret government project. You have been given access to an array of objects representing individuals. The prototype should just use prompt() and alert() for the User Interface (UI). Although this isn’t typical in production, you may use only two files for this project, an HTML file and a JS file for the application.
Technologies: JavaScript
User Stories:
## (5 points): As a developer, I want to make at least 15 consistent commits with good, descriptive messages.
(5 points): As a developer, I want to run validation on any user input, ensuring that a user is re-prompted when they provide invalid input.
## (10 points): As a user, I want to be able to search for someone based on a single criterion - You should be able to find and return a list of people who match the search
## (15 points): As a user, I want to be able to search for someone based on multiple traits (up to a maximum of five criteria at once).
## - i.e., if you search for Gender: male and Eye Color: blue, you should get back a list of people who match the search. In this case, it will be only people who are male with blue eyes.
## (10 points): As a user, I want to be able to look up someone’s information after I find them with the program (display values for the various traits of the found person).
(15 points): As a user, after locating a person, I want to see only that person’s descendants (display the names of the descendants).
## (15 points): As a user, after locating a person, I want to see only that person’s immediate family members, displaying the names of the family members and their relation to the found person.
## - i.e., parents, spouse, siblings
Bonus
As a user, after locating a person, I want to see only that person’s descendants (display the names of the descendants), using recursion.
